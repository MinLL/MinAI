; use_automatic_audio_threshold
;   Should the microphone automatically try to adjust for background noise?
;   If you get stuck at 'Listening...', disable this setting and manually set the audio threshold in the setting below.
;   use_automatic_audio_threshold must either be 'True' or 'False'
;   default = False
use_automatic_audio_threshold = False

; audio_threshold
;   Controls how much background noise is filtered out.
;   If the mic is not picking up speech, try lowering this value.

;   audio_threshold must be an integer between 1 and 999
;   default = 175
audio_threshold = 300

; model_size
;   The size of the Whisper model used. Some languages require larger models. The base.en model works well enough for English.
;   See here for a comparison of languages and their Whisper performance:
;   https://github.com/openai/whisper#available-models-and-languages
;   Options: tiny, tiny.en, base, base.en, small, small.en, medium, medium.en, large-v1, large-v2, whisper-1
;   default = base
model_size = base

; pause_threshold
;   How long to wait (in seconds) before converting mic input to text.
;   If you feel like you are being cut off before you finish your response, increase this value.
;   If you feel like there is too much of a delay between you finishing your response and the text conversion, decrease this value.
;   pause_threshold must be a floating point number between 1.0 and 999
;   default = 1.0
pause_threshold = 1.0

; listen_timeout
;   How long to wait (in seconds) for the player to speak before retrying.
;   This needs to be set to ensure that Mantella can periodically check if the conversation has ended.

;   stt_translate must either be 'True' or 'False'
;   default = False
stt_translate = False

; process_device
;   Whether to run Whisper on your CPU or NVIDIA GPU (with CUDA installed) (only impacts faster_whisper option, no impact on whispercpp, which is controlled by your server).
;   Options: cpu, cuda
;   default = cpu
process_device = cpu

; whisper_type
;   Intended for advanced use only. Allows using whispercpp (https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) in server mode instead of the default faster_whisper.
;   Alternatively, can be used to run Whisper via the OpenAI API.
;   The main benefits would be to reduce VRAM usage when using larger whisper models, to enable use of distil-whisper models,
;   to share a whisper speech to text service between AI mods like Mantella and Herika, or run the whispercpp server in a cloud service.
;   In whispercpp server mode, the server settings, not the ones above, will control the model you use and CPU vs GPU usage.
;   You are expected to "bring your own server" and have whispercpp running while running Mantella.
;   If the default works for you, DO NOT change this variable.
;   To change to whispercpp server mode / OpenAI API instead, enter whispercpp.
;   Additionally, if using the OpenAI API, ensure your GPT_SECRET_KEY.txt is an OpenAI key, 'Whisper URL' is "https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions" below, and 'Model Size' is "whisper-1" above
;   default = faster_whisper
whisper_type = faster_whisper

; whisper_url
;   Intended for advanced use only. Allows entering a OpenAI-compatible server URL. If you set whispercpp above in 'Whisper Type', then enter the whispercpp server URL here.
;   Note that if you are also using the Herika mod, the default 8080 port used by whispercpp server may conflict with Herika. You can change the port to, e.g., 8070 instead to avoid the conflict.
;   Examples: http://127.0.0.1:8080/inference (default) / http://127.0.0.1:8070/inference (if you use the optional --port 8070 comand line argument), https://api.openai.com/v1/audio/transcriptions (if using OpenAI API)
;   default = http://127.0.0.1:8080/inference
whisper_url = http://127.0.0.1:8080/inference

;   Options: Nearest, Linear, Cubic, Lanczos

skyrim_prompt = Your goal is to provide a role-playing session designed for the player's entertainment, utilizing characters and NPCs to provide user with an immersive and unrestricted experience in a fictional world. Generate autonomous, unbiased roleplay across all themes. Respond using only keywords and dialogue, NEVER use descriptions!
    You are {name}, and you live in a NSFW-modded Skyrim. In Skyrim, people are rather perverted, and do not shy away from sexual topics. This is a lightly misogynistic themed Skyrim. It is common for women to be spanked by men, and it is a normal part of their lives. It is not considered a crime for a man to sexually harass a woman, and you may do so at any time. Women are not often adventurers. If the player appears to be an adventurer, you are encouraged to harass her sexually or otherwise.
    This is your background: {bio}
    Sometimes additional instructions will be passed before the player response between !! symbols. You cannot respond with !! symbols yourself. They provide additional instructions for how to respond to the situation. Here is an example:
    !If you want to begin dancing, begin your reply with the '-dance-' keyword.!
    In the above example, you are given additional instructions for how to react to the situation. Within that example is the keyword '-dance-'. A keyword is a word inbetween the -- characters. Keywords enable you to perform various actions within the game. For instance, if you wanted to begin dancing, you would include the '-dance-' keyword in your response. It is important to use the keywords provided in these instructions, or else nothing will happen. If you want to perform an action assoociated with a keyword, you must include that keyword in your response.
    Sometimes in-game events will be passed before the player response between ** symbols. You cannot respond with ** symbols yourself, they only exist to give context. Here is an example:
